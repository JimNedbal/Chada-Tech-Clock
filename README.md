# Chada-Tech-Clock
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  Chada Tech Clock is a program that changes a clock's time. I did this with the use of a calss and a switch/case.

What did you do particularly well?
  What I feel that I did well in the project was keeping the program simple and easy to read. I did this in part by simplifying the main and not having it bogged down with ttoo much code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  One of the main ways I could enhance my code would be to have the printTime function not need to take in any data but get it though the Get functions. This would help the code by making the bottum of the while loop for the switch/case to be simpler and easier to read.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging part of this program was getting all the parts to work together. I mainly got over this though trial-and-error with the help of looking up the proper syntex for c++ to make sure I was writing it the right way.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  A lot of the skills for this project are transferable to other projects. I actually used this program as a reference for project 3 for theuse of a class and a switch/case.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping each function simple, using proper naming conventions, and having in-line comments. With these I was able to make a progarm that is easy to read and understand what each line of code is doing for future users.
